CSS Positions:



    4 css prop - using which we could move any DOM element to any req position on the page..

        top 
        bottom
        left 
        right 

        The above four prop can only be applied to the dom elements which are falling in z axis
    
        in order to apply/consider the above 4 prop the element should be positioned non static

        position: static / relative / absolute / fixed / sticky


        position: static; -> Cannot be moved from its default position 


        



Any dom element with position static, allways falls under xy axis 

Any DOM element with position non satic will automatically move from xy to Z axis 


position: relative;
    1. it is capable of considering left, right , top and bottom pop 
    2. It is automatically moving to z axis 
    3. It is not loosing its own space in xy axis .
    4. this will always moves relative to its own original posiion(xy). 


posiion: absolute
    1. it is capable of considering left, right , top and bottom pop 
    2. It is automatically moving to z axis 
    3. It will not hold its own original space under xy axis.
    4. how am i moving ? 
        1. allways moves based on its parent poision 
        2. i only depend on the pareNt/ grand parent / grand grand parent etc. whose poisition is non static
        3. if non of the parent/grand parents have poision as non static, it directly depends on the body tag.
