Block level and inline :


    Block level elements:
        1. 'div' tag 
        2. By default the content within the block level elemen,t will automatically come to new line
        3. The element/content which is following the block level element, also comes to new line. 
        4. By default the block level element occupies 100% width of its container.
        5. We can always control the dimentions (through width and height property) of any block level element.
        6. h1-h6, p , td, li etc 

    Inline elemnts:
        1. 'span' tag is best example for inline elements 
        2. Inline elements always tries to render within the same line 
        3. By default it occupies the width based on the content its holding 
        4. We cannot control the dimentions of inline elements ever.
