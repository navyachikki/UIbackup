  <p  id="Newsitem1"; name="newsContent" class="newsContentStory">In the first two
    decades of the 21st century, the world had to press reboot button twice—during the financial crisis in 2008 and when
    a microscopic virus snapped lives out of millions between 2019 and 2021. Both disasters changed the world order
    forever, but one country emerged stronger every time—India, that is Bharat.
    <br>
    The post pandemic world is caught in two unending wars, one along Russia-Ukraine border and one in Gaza. These
    unwarranted conflicts, where human lives are daily casualties, now have disrupted the global sanity once again,
    throwing mankind into an uncertain future. The American supremacy is no longer what it used to be, the pace of
    China’s growth has slowed down, Russia is embroiled in a war it can’t get out of, Europe is caught in its own
    inertia, Africa is still struggling to play catch-up with the rest of the world and West Asian conflict threatens to
    spiral out of control any moment.
