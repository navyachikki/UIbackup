two different ways we could send data to the server
    1. manually reading and sending data  - JS 
    2. Automatically through form tag - Form/html

        <form> -> used to read the data Automatically from the input elements under it, and Automatically send the data to the specified server
                .. 
                .. . 
                ...
                ...
                .
        </form>

        form takes 2 mandate attributes:
            action -> using which we could specify the server url, to which data has to be sent 
            method


            url - > http://abc.com/data 
            http://google.com/search 

            http://localhost:8081/data/info 

            method -> type of communication -> GET/POST /DELETE/Query etc..

            GET communication -> DAta will be automatically append tothe url, through query parameters 

            POST Communication -> user data will be apended to the request header, which will not be shown on the url, but data will be sent to server.
